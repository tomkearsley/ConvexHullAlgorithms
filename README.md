# ConvexHullAlgorithms
Three Convex Hull Algorithms I created in Python. 
The three Algorithms are:
- Giftwrapping
- Montone Chaining
- Graham Scan
Included is a set of test points and a automated file to run the test points and algorithms against each other. 
A excel spreadsheet of performance is also provided.
Along with a excel spreadsheet is a report describing in detail the performance comparisons and differences.
